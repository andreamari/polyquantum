# Polyquantum Markdown documents

This folder contains version-controlled Markdown documents that formalize the research ideas developed within _Polyquantum_.

There are many ways to add or modify files on GitHub. However, if you are not familiar with GitHub, **we recommend the short guide below**. It only requires using the web interface in your browser‚Äîno need to clone or download anything to your computer.

## How to add a new markdown document

1. If you want to contribute to an existing Polyquantum project, jump to point 2.\
   If you want to contribute a new research idea/project/problem:
    - If you haven't done it yet, open a [new issue](https://github.com/andreamari/polyquantum/issues/new/choose).
    - After the issue is created, a new folder `/docs/[ISSUE_NUMBER]/` will be generated.
2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the Polyquantum project you‚Äôd like to contribute to.
3. Click the _Add file_ button at the top right.
4. Click the _Fork this repository_ button (only required for your first contribution).
5. Name your file using a progressive number prefix (`1-...`, `2-...`, `3-...`, etc.). E.g., if this is the first document in the project (beyond the default `README.md` file), name it `1-my-file-name.md`.  
6. Make sure the file name ends with the `.md` extension.
7. Write your document directly in the online text editor:  
   - Remember to add authors and affiliations.  
   - Use `#`, `##`, `###`, ‚Ä¶ for titles, sections, and subsections.  
   - Use `$...$` for inline LaTeX equations.  
   - Use `$$...$$` for block LaTeX equations.  
   - You can use [footnotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes) for references.  
   - For more commands, see this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).  
8. Above the document text, click the _Preview_ button.  
9. Carefully check the preview of your document.  
10. When ready, click the green _Commit changes..._ button at the top right.  
11. Click the green _Propose changes..._ button. After this step, **your contribution is not yet submitted to Polyquantum!**  
12. Click the green _Create pull request_ button.  
13. Fill in the required information and complete the pull request.  
14. At this point, your contribution is formally proposed to Polyquantum. We‚Äôll review your pull request.  
15. We may close your pull request if the document is judged to be of poor quality or inappropriate. **This step is not a scientific peer review** but rather a light moderation process, similar to what is used in the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) repository.  
16. We may also request changes to the text.  
17. If accepted, your contribution will be merged into the Polyquantum repository! üéâ
